What is Angular?
----------------
Angular is UI Development Framework or Platform for developing simple and complex web application
It is client-side technology
It is build using TypeScript
It is used to build SPA (Single Page Application)
It is component-based framework
It provide a collection of well-integrated libraries that covers a wide varieties of features including routing, form management, client-server communication and more ....

Version of Angular 
------------------
Angular JS - 1.x (Javascript)

Angular 2 - TypeScript
Angular 4
Angular 5
....
..

Core Building Blocks of Angular
-------------------------------
Modules 	
Component 
	-Class (TypeScript Class)
		properties 
		method 
	-Template (HTML Code)
	-Meta Data (Extra Data for the Component)
Services 
Directives 
Pipes
Routing 

Architecture of Angular Application
-----------------------------------
Angular application is based on the idea of Components.
An angular application start with a top-level component called Root Component
We then add child component forming a tree of lossely coupled components

Software Requirement
--------------------
NodeJs and npm 
Visual Studio Code 

Installing Angular CLI 
----------------------
npm install -g @angular/cli

ng --help :- to see all the possible options

ng version :-to view the version of angular cli installed 

creating a new angualar project 

ng new <<nameofproject>>

ng new demo-angularapp

cd demo-angularapp

to run angular application

ng serve
or 
npm start 

Components 
-----------
Component are the building block of angular application

Each component has the following artifacts by default:

-The Component Class (TypeScript Class)

	<<component-name>>.component.ts
	
	Root Component is know as app.component.ts
	
	Example :- A product list component 
				productlist.component.ts
				
			Register Component :- register.component.ts

-The Component's Template (View)

	<<component-name>>.component.html
	Root component view is app.component.html
	
	Eg :- product list :- productlist.component.html
		  register :- register.component.html
		  
-The Component's Stylesheet 
	
	<<component-name>>.component.css 
	Root Component :- app.component.css
	
	Eg:- product list :- productlist.component.css
	     register :- productlist.component.css
		 
-The Component's Unit testing code 

	<<component-name>>.component.spec.ts 
	Root Component :- app.component.spec.ts
	
The Module Class
----------------
Every Module is TypeScript Class
The class is decorated with the @NgModule decorator 
Root Module is app.Module.ts  

Bootstrapping 
-------------
Bootstrapping is a technique of initializing or loading an Angular Application 

The Angular takes the following steps to load our first view 

1.Index.html Loads 
2.Angular, Third-party libraries and Application Loads
3.Main.ts the application entry point 
4.Root Module
5.Root Component
6.Template 

runtime.js - WebPack Runtime

WebPack :- It is bundler. It scans the application looking for javascripts and merges them into one or more big files.It has the ability to any kind of files like Javascript,css, Images,HTML etc..

polyfill.js :- It has script for supporting variety of latest modern browser

styles.js :- The file contains the global style rule bundled as javascript file.

vendor.js :- Contains the scripts from the Angular Core Library and onther 3rd Party library

main.js :- code to the application

Creating Components
-------------------

ng generate component <<component-name>>

ng g c <<component-name>>

ng generate component login :- create a login component with all the files in folder name login

ng g c register --flat --skip-tests :- create a register component without test logic in the app root folder 

Component 
---------
Component Class - TypeScript Class

Decorator :- A decorator will the angular to consider the compoenent class as a Angular Component.It is similar to Data Annotation (Java) or Attributes (.NET)

@Component Decorator 
	Selector :- A tag name given to a component which can be used in the html code 
	
		Root Component :- app-root ==><app-root></app-root>
		Login Component :- app-login ==> <app-login></app-login>
		
		app-->ct
		
		angular.json -- contains the information about the angular cli and compiler. Every project will its own angular.json file
		
	Template URL :- path to the html code 
		or 
	Template :- Inline HTML Code 
	
	Style URL :- pathe of css file 
		or 
	Style :- Css Code 
	
npm install --save bootstrap

Angular Data Binding 
--------------------
Data Binding is a technique , where data stays in-sync between the component(TS class) and the view(HTML)
Whenever the user updates the data in the view, Angular update components or vice-versa

One-Way Binding 
---------------
In this approach data flow in one direction 
Component to View
To implement One-Way data binding we use interpolation

Interpolation allows us to include an expression as part of a string literal enclose double curly bracket {{ stringliteral }}.
The angular evaluates the expression in the string literal and replace the string literal with the actual value that you want to display in the view 

interpolation --> {{ expression }}

eg:- <p> {{ id }} </p>

Two-Way Binding 
---------------
Two-Way data binding means that changes made to our model in the component are propogated to the view and any changes made in the view are immediately updated in the component.
Two-Way data binding id useful in forms 
The angular uses the ngModel directive to achieve Two-Way data binding 


Employee Name : <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">

ngModel is a part of FormsModule

Event Binding
-------------
Event Biniding allows us to bind events such as click, keystroke, hover etc....

Javascript :- <button onclick="functionname()">Click Me</button>

Angular :- <button (click)="functionname()">Click Me</button>

We can pass $event object to an event handler to get additional information about the event

<button (click)="methodname($event)">Click Me</button>

$event contains all the information about the event

If it's a DOM Element, $event contains the information about DOM element
If it's a Component, $event contains the information about the Component

.target property :- helps to get the information about the target

Can we use same event handler with multiple element ? Yes 

Component also raise Events 
	-EventEmitter<T>
	
Template Reference Variables
----------------------------
This allows us to reference a portion of a template in another portson of the same template 

<element #variablename></element>

<input type="text" #city>

Component Communication 
-----------------------

	Parent --> Child 
		Parent compoenent passes data to the child componenet
		@input decorator
		Root-->BookList-->Book
		
		a.In the child component, create a data member and decorate it with the @input decoratror
			@input ---> @angular/core
		b.From the parent component , when rendering the child component passes data to the markup of the child component by using property binding syntax
		
			<element [property]="value">
		
		c.The child component can use the member marked with the @Input decorator to access the data passed by Parent component
		
	Child --> Parent
		Child component passes data back to parent component
		@output decorator 
		EventEmitter<T> class (notification)
		
		a.In the child component, create an instance of EventEmitter<T> class specifying the type of data to be passed to the parent
		
			EventEmitter<T> --- @angular/core
			
		b.Decorate the datamember with the @output decorator
			@Output allows the parent to receive notification and respond to it.
			
		c.Emit the custom event from the child component using the emit methods of the EventEmitter.
		
		d.In the parent component's template, use event binindg syntax so the parent can attach an eventhandler to the custome notification fire by the child component.
		
		
	@ViewChild 
	@ViewChildern
	
	Use to access DOM element of a component from its TypeScript Code 
	
	@ViewChild() returns first matching element 
	@ViewChildern() returns an array of DOM elmenet
	It can be used to access properties/method of child component as well 
	
	a.Create a data member in the class 
		button : ElementRef
		
		ElementRef- wrapper around a DOM element
		
	b.Decorate the data member with the @ViewChild decorator
	
	c.Access the DOM element in the ngAfterViewInit() lifecycle hook
	
Directives 
----------
Angular directives helps us to manipulate the DOM.
You can change the apperance, behaviour or layout of the DOM element using the directives 
They help you to extend your HTML

Component Directives
	They are directive with a template(view) for a component 
	
Structural Directives
	These directives can change the DOM layout by adding or removing DOM element 
	
	*ngIf
		<element *ngIf="condition">.....</element>
		
	ngSwitch 
		*ngSwitchCase - to specify cases 
		*ngSwitchDefault - to specify the default case 
		
		<div [ngSwitch]="num">
			<div *ngSwitchCase="1">One</div>
			<div *ngSwitchCase="2">Two</div>
			.
			.
			.
			.
			<div *ngSwitchDefault>Default Message</div>
		</div>
		
	ngFor
		<element *ngFor="let variable of collection/array">
			{{ varaiable }}
		</element>
		
		"variable" is know as "template input variable"
			scope is only within <element>
			
		*ngFor Variables 
		
			index: contains the zero based index of item being iterated 
			
			*ngFor = "let b of books;let i=index"
			
			odd: returns true if the item is an odd item 
			
			even: returns true if the item ia an even item 
			
			*ngFor ="let b of books;let i=index;let o=odd;let e=even"
			
			trackBy:function
				Tells Angular how each item in the collection must be tracked
				Without trackBy, Angular re-renders the entire DOM tree, event if the data is not changed
				
			a.Create a funcyion which returns a unique value from the model, which angular will use to track each item
				Ex:- eid,pid,bookid..etc
				
			b.Use the trackBy property with the *ngFor and specify the name of the tracking function create
			
			if the data changes, the existing DOM elements will not be re-rendered and only the new DOM elements would be add to the DOM tree
		
Attribute Directive 

	ngModel 
	ngStyle 
	ngClass
	
Creating Custom Directives
--------------------------

a.Creating a custom attribute directive 
b.Creating a custom structural directive

a.Creating a custom attribute directive

	1.Create a TS class and decorate it with @Directive() decorator
	2.Declare the directive in the "declaration" section of the AppModule 
	3.Use the directive in the component's template 
	
	Angular CLI --> ng generate directive <<directivename>>
	
	First decide, what the custom directive is supposed to do?
	
	Example:
		AlertDirective (directive class)
			<element [alert]></element>
			
		What should it do?
		When applied to an HTML Element, it must display an alert message 
		
			<p [alert]>Hello</p> --- Display an alert message
			<span [alert]>Welcome</span>
			
		Inside the custom directive, we can respond to the event of the HOST ELEMENT
		
		a.Inside the directive , create a handler function
		b.Decorate it with @HostListener() decorator and specify the DOM event
		
		A custom directive can be applied to a DOM element as well as to a custom component
		
		Accessing the HOST Element from within the directive 
			To change the behaviour of the HOST element 
			Inject the ElementRef service into the directive class
			
	Just like components, directives can also have input properties (marked with @Input())
	
	<p appAlert inputmessage="Welcome"></p>
	
	<p appAlert inputmessage="Hello"></p>
	
	"inputmessage" is an input property
	
	<p appAlert [inputmessage]="'This is Some Message'"></p>
	
	If we need to pass a literal to input property using property binding syntax, use single quotes within double quotes"
	
	<span appAlert="Hi">....</span>
		OR
	<span [appAlert] = "Hi">....</span>
	
	we can create getter and setter in the directive class to make the above code work 
	Decorate the setter with the @Input() Decorator 
	
Creating a Custom Structural directive 
--------------------------------------
Objective :- Creat a Custom structural directive which repeats/clone an element for the specified number of time (similar to ngFor)

Usage :- 

	<element *appRepeat="10"></element
	<p appRepeat="10>Hello</p>
	
	
	1.Create a directive
	
		ng g d repeat --skip-tests
		
	2.Two things needed for creating a structural directive
		a.ViewContainerRef
		b.TemplateRef
		
	3.Inject the above service/classes in the constructor of the directive as private variables
	
	ViewContainerRef corresponds to a location the DOM where the embedded view is create 
	TemplateRef represents an embedded template
	
	4.Create a setter and getter with name appRepeat and decorate the setter with @Input decorator
	
	5.The logic to clone the element will be inside the setter 
	
	Logic 
		Use the createEmbeddedView() of the ViewContainerRef passing templateRef
		
		this.viewcontainer.createEmbeddedView(this.templateref);
		
Pipes
=====
Formerly know as "filters" in AngularJS (1.x)
A pipe allows you to transform some input and return the transformed value back

input ------> PIPE(transform)-------> TransformedData

Many Built-In Pipes are available 
	1.decimal
	2.currency
	3.date
	4.json
	5.uppercase
	6.lowercase
	7.titlecase 
	8.async(used with observables)
	.....
	
	Syntax :- Pipes are always used in template 
	
		{{ expression/input to the pipe | pipename }}
		
		{{ dob | date }}
		{{ price | currency }}

		Chaining of Pipes 
		
		{{ expresssion/input | pipe1 | pipe2 | pipe3.. }}
		
Custom Pipe
-----------
Create a custom to get square of a number 

	{{ 2 |square }}
	
	1.Create a class decorated with @Pipe() decorator , optionally implement the PipeTransform interface
	
	2.Write the transformation logic inside the transform() method 
	
	3.Angular call the transform() when the pipe is used
	
	ng generate pipe <<pipename>>
		OR 
	ng g p <<pipename>>
	
	First argument to the transform() method is the value on the left side of the pipe.
	Additional arguments can be passed as parameters to the transform() -optional
	
Service 
-------
A service is a TS Class which contains logic that can be used by multiple components

A service is a Singleton instance - Angular creates once instance of the service per application and the same instance is shared by all the components

Every service is created using @Injectable decorator 

A service can be injected into compoenents, directives, pipes using Angular Built-In dependency injection mechanism.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique in which a class receives its dependencies from external source rather than creating them itself

class Engine
{
	constructor(parameter){}
}

class Tires
{
	constructor() {}
}

Without DI
----------
class Car{
	engine;
	tires;
	
	constructor()
	{
		this.engine = new Engine();
		this.tires =  new Tires();
	}
}

With DI 
-------
class Car
{
	engine;
	tires;
	
	constructor(engine,tires)
	{
		this.engine =engine;
		thie.tires = tires;
	}
}

var myEngine = new Engine(parameter);
var myTires = new Tires(parameter);

var myCar = new Car(myEngine,myTires);

	DI Code ---> Create instance of dependencies --> Inject ---> Component

HR Management System 
--------------------
Employee (Id,Firstname,LastName,Department,....)
	
	2 Components
		employee-list (contains id and first-name of the employee)
		employee-details (display the details information of the employee)
		
	ng generate service <<service-name>>
		OR 
	ng g s <<service-name>>
	
	A service class is decorated with @Injectable() decorator
	@Injectable() makes the service class injectable using Angular's built-in DI
	The class automatically participates in Angular's DI Mechanism 
	Angular's DI mechanism will create instance of the service and inject them into components, pipes, directives when required
	
In a real-time application , the data will come from an API or Web Service.
In Angular to interact with an API we make use of HTTPModule 

HttpModule 
	
	HttpClient  - @angular/common/http
	
	-The ability to request typed reponse objects
	-Error handling 
	-Testing 
	-Request and Response interception
	
	GET 
	POST
	PUT 
	PATCH
	DELETE

What is an Observable?
----------------------
Observable is an asynchronous pattren.

In Observable pattern we have an Observable(Publisher) and an Observer.
Observer observe the Observable.
In many implementation an Observer is also called as Subscriber

An Observable can have many subscribers 

Observable emits items or notifications over time to which an subscriber can subscribe
When a subscriber subscribes to an Observable , the subscriber also specifies a callback function

Routing 
--------
Routing is a technique to navigate between view in a SPA(Single Page Application)

In Angular, the RouteModule (@angular/router) has the API related to routing

Angulat interprets changes to the browser URL and performs the navigation based on the routes configured

	URL :-
	
		Every Angular Application has a base URL 
		
		http://servername/appname:port/index.html 
		
		http://localhost:4200/index.html - Base URL of an Angular App 
		
		During routing, the base URL does not change 
		Routing starts from the end of the base URL 
		
		Route Could be :
		
		http://localhost:4200/index.html/home --> HomeComponent
		http://localhost:4200/index.html/aboutus --> AboutComponent
		baseURL/contact --> ContactComponent
		
		In the index.html , the "base href" element tell angular how the URL's should be generated
			Default is "/"
			
			http://localhost:4200/index.html/home
			
			We can change the value of base href 
			<base href="ct"/>
			
			http://localhost:4200/ct/home
			http://localhost:4200/ct/aboutus
			.
			.
			.......
			
Steps to Use Routing 
--------------------
a.Define routes for the application
	Routes can be defined in "app-routing.module.ts"
	
b.Create an array which contains one or more "route" objects	
	Each route object contains the following properties
	
		1.path --> the URL Pattern
		2.component --> The componenet to be shown when the paterrns specified 
		3.childern
		4.redirectTo
		
c.Use RouteModule.forRoot() method passing the route array to inject all the routing service and obtain a RouterModule --> App Level 

d.Import the RouteModule created in the above step into the app module
