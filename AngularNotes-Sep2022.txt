Angular Training 
----------------

What is Angular?
----------------
Angular is UI Development Framework or Platform for developing simple and complex web application
It is client-side technology
It is build using TypeScript
It is used to build SPA (Single Page Application)
It is component-based framework
It provide a collection o well-integrated libraries that covers a wide varieties of features including routing, form management, client-server communication and more ....

Traditional Application 
-----------------------
E-Commerce - Asp.Net Web Forms 4.5 or 3.5

Version of Angular 
------------------
Angular JS - 1.x (Javascript)

Angular 2 - TypeScript
Angular 4
Angular 5
....
..

Core Building Blocks of Angular
-------------------------------
Component 
	-Class (TypeScript Class)
		properties 
		method 
	-Template (HTML Code)
	-Meta Data (Extra Data for the Component)
Services 
Directives 
Pipes
Modules
Routing 

Architecture of Angular Application
-----------------------------------
Angular application is based on the idea of Components.
An angular application start with a top-level component called Root Component
We then add child component forming a tree of lossely coupled components

Software Requirement
--------------------
NodeJs and npm 
Visual Studio Code 

Installing Angular CLI 
----------------------
npm install -g @angular/cli

ng --help :- to see all the possible options

ng version :-to view the version of angular cli installed 

creating a new angualar project 

ng new <<nameofproject>>

ng new demo-angularapp

cd demo-angularapp

to run angular application

ng serve
or 
npm start 

Components 
-----------
Component are the building block of angular application

Each component has the following artifacts by default:

-The Component Class (TypeScript Class)

	<<component-name>>.component.ts
	
	Root Component is know as app.component.ts
	
	Example :- A product list component 
				productlist.component.ts
				
			Register Component :- register.component.ts

-The Component's Template (View)

	<<component-name>>.component.html
	Root component view is app.component.html
	
	Eg :- product list :- productlist.component.html
		  register :- register.component.html
		  
-The Component's Stylesheet 
	
	<<component-name>>.component.css 
	Root Component :- app.component.css
	
	Eg:- product list :- productlist.component.css
	     register :- productlist.component.css
		 
-The Component's Unit testing code 

	<<component-name>>.component.spec.ts 
	Root Component :- app.component.spec.ts
	
The Module Class
----------------
Every Module is TypeScript Class
The class is decorated with the @NgModule decorator 
Root Module is app.Module.ts  

Bootstrapping 
-------------
Bootstrapping is a technique of initializing or loading an Angular Application 

The Angular takes the following steps to load our first view 

1.Index.html Loads 
2.Angular, Third-party libraries and Application Loads
3.Main.ts the application entry point 
4.Root Module
5.Root Component
6.Template 

runtime.js - WebPack Runtime

WebPack :- It is bundler. It scans the application looking for javascripts and merges them into one or more big files.It has the ability to any kind of files like Javascript,css, Images,HTML etc..

polyfill.js :- It has script for supporting variety of latest modern browser

styles.js :- The file contains the global style rule bundled as javascript file.

vendor.js :- Contains the scripts from the Angular Core Library and onther 3rd Party library

main.js :- code to the application

Creating Components
-------------------

ng generate component <<component-name>>

ng g c <<component-name>>

ng generate component login :- create a login component with all the files in folder name login

ng g c register --flat --skip-tests :- create a register component without test logic in the app root folder 

Component 
---------
Component Class - TypeScript Class

Decorator :- A decorator will the angular to consider the compoenent class as a Angular Component.It is similar to Data Annotation (Java) or Attributes (.NET)

@Component Decorator 
	Selector :- A tag name given to a component which can be used in the html code 
	
		Root Component :- app-root ==><app-root></app-root>
		Login Component :- app-login ==> <app-login></app-login>
		
		app-->ct
		
		angular.json -- contains the information about the angular cli and compiler. Every project will its own angular.json file
		
	Template URL :- path to the html code 
		or 
	Template :- Inline HTML Code 
	
	Style URL :- pathe of css file 
		or 
	Style :- Css Code 
	
npm install --save bootstrap

Angular Data Binding 
--------------------
Data Binding is a technique , where data stays in-sync between the component(TS class) and the view(HTML)
Whenever the user updates the data in the view, Angular update components or vice-versa

One-Way Binding 
---------------
In this approach data flow in one direction 
Component to View
To implement One-Way data binding we use interpolation

Interpolation allows us to include an expression as part of a string literal enclose double curly bracket {{ stringliteral }}.
The angular evaluates the expression in the string literal and replace the string literal with the actual value that you want to display in the view 

interpolation --> {{ expression }}

eg:- <p> {{ id }} </p>

Two-Way Binding 
---------------
Two-Way data binding means that changes made to our model in the component are propogated to the view and any changes made in the view are immediately updated in the component.
Two-Way data binding id useful in forms 
The angular uses the ngModel directive to achieve Two-Way data binding 


Employee Name : <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">

ngModel is a part of FormsModule

Event Binding
-------------
Event Biniding allows us to bind events such as click, keystroke, hover etc....

Javascript :- <button onclick="functionname()">Click Me</button>

Angular :- <button (click)="functionname()">Click Me</button>

We can pass $event object to an event handler to get additional information about the event

<button (click)="methodname($event)">Click Me</button>

$event contains all the information about the event

If it's a DOM Element, $event contains the information about DOM element
If it's a Component, $event contains the information about the Component

.target property :- helps to get the information about the target

Can we use same event handler with multiple element ? Yes 

Component also raise Events 
	-EventEmitter<T>
	
Template Reference Variables
----------------------------
This allows us to reference a portion of a template in another portson of the same template 

<element #variablename></element>

<input type="text" #city>

Component Communication 
-----------------------

	Parent --> Child 
		Parent compoenent passes data to the child componenet
		@input decorator
		Root-->BookList-->Book
		
		a.In the child component, create a data member and decorate it with the @input decoratror
			@input ---> @angular/core
		b.From the parent component , when rendering the child component passes data to the markup of the child component by using property binding syntax
		
			<element [property]="value">
		
		c.The child component can use the member marked with the @Input decorator to access the data passed by Parent component
		
	Child --> Parent
		Child component passes data back to parent component
		@output decorator 
		EventEmitter<T> class (notification)
		
		a.In the child component, create an instance of EventEmitter<T> class specifying the type of data to be passed to the parent
		
			EventEmitter<T> --- @angular/core
			
		b.Decorate the datamember with the @output decorator
			@Output allows the parent to receive notification and respond to it.
			
		c.Emit the custom event from the child component using the emit methods of the EventEmitter.
		
		d.In the parent component's template, use event binindg syntax so the parent can attach an eventhandler to the custome notification fire by the child component.
		
		
	@ViewChild 
	@ViewChildern
	
	Use to access DOM element of a component from its TypeScript Code 
	
	@ViewChild() returns first matching element 
	@ViewChildern() returns an array of DOM elmenet
	It can be used to access properties/method of child component as well 
	
	a.Create a data member in the class 
		button : ElementRef
		
		ElementRef- wrapper around a DOM element
		
	b.Decorate the data member with the @ViewChild decorator
	
	c.Access the DOM element in the ngAfterViewInit() lifecycle hook
	
Directives 
----------
Angular directives helps us to manipulate the DOM.
You can change the apperance, behaviour or layout of the DOM element using the directives 
They help you to extend your HTML

Component Directives
	They are directive with a template(view) for a component 
	
Structural Directives
	These directives can change the DOM layout by adding or removing DOM element 
	
	*ngIf
		<element *ngIf="condition">.....</element>
		
	ngSwitch 
		*ngSwitchCase - to specify cases 
		*ngSwitchDefault - to specify the default case 
		
		<div [ngSwitch]="num">
			<div *ngSwitchCase="1">One</div>
			<div *ngSwitchCase="2">Two</div>
			.
			.
			.
			.
			<div *ngSwitchDefault>Default Message</div>
		</div>
		
	ngFor
		<element *ngFor="let variable of collection/array">
			{{ varaiable }}
		</element>
		
		"variable" is know as "template input variable"
			scope is only within <element>
			
			
Attribute Directive 

	ngModel 
	ngStyle 
	ngClass
